Parallel Sort Parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following parameter enables you to activate or deactivate full
parallel sort for order-by operations.

When full parallel sort is inactive (`false`), each existing data
partition is sorted (in parallel), and then all data partitions are
merged into a single node.

When full parallel sort is active (`true`), the data is first sampled,
and then repartitioned so that each partition contains data that is
greater than the previous partition. The data in each partition is then
sorted (in parallel), but the sorted partitions are not merged into a
single node.

* *compiler.sort.parallel*: A boolean specifying whether full parallel
sort is active (`true`) or inactive (`false`). The default value is
`true`.
