The SET statement can be used to override some cluster-wide
configuration parameters for a specific request:

---------------------------------
SET <IDENTIFIER> <STRING_LITERAL>
---------------------------------

As parameter identifiers are qualified names (containing a '.') they
have to be escaped using backticks (``). Note that changing query
parameters will not affect query correctness but only impact performance
characteristics, such as response time and throughput.

[[parallelism-parameter]]
=== Parallelism Parameter

The system can execute each request using multiple cores on multiple
machines (a.k.a., partitioned parallelism) in a cluster. A user can
manually specify the maximum execution parallelism for a request to
scale it up and down using the following parameter:

* *compiler.parallelism*: the maximum number of CPU cores can be used to
process a query. There are three cases of the value _p_ for
compiler.parallelism:
** _p_ < 0 or _p_ > the total number of cores in a cluster: the system
will use all available cores in the cluster;
** _p_ = 0 (the default): the system will use the storage parallelism
(the number of partitions of stored datasets) as the maximum parallelism
for query processing;
** all other cases: the system will use the user-specified number as the
maximum number of CPU cores to use for executing the query.

[[example]]
Example

--------------------------------------------------------------------
SET `compiler.parallelism` "16";

SELECT u.name AS uname, m.message AS message
FROM GleambookUsers u JOIN GleambookMessages m ON m.authorId = u.id;
--------------------------------------------------------------------

[[memory-parameters]]
=== Memory Parameters

In the system, each blocking runtime operator such as join, group-by and
order-by works within a fixed memory budget, and can gracefully spill to
disks if the memory budget is smaller than the amount of data they have
to hold. A user can manually configure the memory budget of those
operators within a query. The supported configurable memory parameters
are:

* *compiler.groupmemory*: the memory budget that each parallel group-by
operator instance can use; 32MB is the default budget.
* *compiler.sortmemory*: the memory budget that each parallel sort
operator instance can use; 32MB is the default budget.
* *compiler.joinmemory*: the memory budget that each parallel hash join
operator instance can use; 32MB is the default budget.
* *compiler.windowmemory*: the memory budget that each parallel window
aggregate operator instance can use; 32MB is the default budget.

For each memory budget value, you can use a 64-bit integer value with a
1024-based binary unit suffix (for example, B, KB, MB, GB). If there is
no user-provided suffix, "B" is the default suffix. See the following
examples.

[[example-1]]
Example

----------------------------------
SET `compiler.groupmemory` "64MB";

SELECT msg.authorId, COUNT(*)
FROM GleambookMessages msg
GROUP BY msg.authorId;
----------------------------------

[[example-2]]
Example

-------------------------------------------
SET `compiler.sortmemory` "67108864";

SELECT VALUE user
FROM GleambookUsers AS user
ORDER BY ARRAY_LENGTH(user.friendIds) DESC;
-------------------------------------------

[[example-3]]
Example

--------------------------------------------------------------------
SET `compiler.joinmemory` "132000KB";

SELECT u.name AS uname, m.message AS message
FROM GleambookUsers u JOIN GleambookMessages m ON m.authorId = u.id;
--------------------------------------------------------------------
